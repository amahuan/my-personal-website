# My Personal Website

This site is meant to be minimalist in design but also colorful since I
like bright colors.

The intention of the site is to let people know more about me.  Instead
of it being a boring site with static information, I wanted to create tiles 
that gradually reveal information about myself.  There are clues about a
few things I'm passionate about and the viewer needs to enter the first 
letter of the word to reveal the answer.  The site also includes some of
my favorite links, which actually reveal or provide hints for some of the
answers.
